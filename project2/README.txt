Describe your solution here:

Section 1)
Describe what synchronization primitives are used, how threads are created, the lifetime of the thread, and speedup observed with the 'time' command from making these changes. Make sure to use an equivalent scene definition when comparing performance. An unmodified project2_starter.zip source should be a baseline.

Section 2)
Describe what structural changes are being done to allow parallel operation of the physics and rendering code. Is this arrangement of code, with barriers before positions are changed? Or perhaps multiple representations of the position by duplicating some data?
